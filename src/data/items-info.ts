Under the silver moon and the lights of the tourist barges that criss-cross the quay a few metres away, the bodies mingle to the rhythm of the music. It is then that two glances cross paths. A discreet invitation brings them to the centre of the track. As if they were carried away, they dance in the heat of the night. From this hand-to-hand seduction punctuated by knowing smiles, they end up slipping away to give free flow to more carnal desires. In the early morning, the sheets give off a scent of sleepless nights, mischievous and lascivious embraces.',

An exploration of dichotomies and disharmonies, Mixed Emotions aligns the familiar and the unexpected to create a fragrance cohesive in its contrasts. Drawing on the Byredo philosophy of translating fragmented memories and abstract ideas into scent, Mixed Emotions presents an olfactive sketch of our current, collective state of mind. Comforting notes of maté and the sharp sweetness of cassis sit within a wooden framework; the reassuring scent of black tea disturbed by violet leaf synthetics. Here is a refreshing reminder that it is okay to not be okay – and that from unsettling experiences, a new reality might emerge.',

Anne finds comfort in literature, and the garden of her home, which nestles in the hills overlooking downtown LA. The scent represents her only in the way all such choices represent us. It can be concrete, like a beautiful green rose. Yet, it can be abstract, just like an Erik Satie composition for it is a puzzle so mysterious that it is difficult to unravel. The perfume invigorates the senses with its fresh, inviting appeal. One feels good wearing it.',

It is the sensation of clean, energizing freshness, formed of bergamot from Italy and the verticality of aldehydes with sophisticated, slightly metallic, effervescent facets. At the heart of this fragrance lies an airy aura conveyed by a bouquet of flowers structured by jasmine absolute from Egypt, sweet pea and mock orange. In the base notes, this universe of whiteness surrenders to an enveloping, comforting sensation thanks to a sandalwood and white musk accord.',

      'The entire composition plays with contrasts and oppositions. The notes answer one another in a permanent conversation drawing a new olfactory map on the skin, on the revers of a cashmere jacket, or even right there, next to the buttons of the sleeves, on the wrist. If it could be summed up into one single image, it would be a compass: north for the zested liveliness  of the mandarin to which the south would answer with the everlasting flower and to highlight this olfactory frame, the density of suede notes on the west would balance the subtle and delicate florality of the violet on the east. Those are four directions for a perfumed journey to a new imaginary world and new codes of elegance.',

The spirit of the volcano, its sovereign presence. Basalm fir and white leather. An island of character, made for a zesty, energetic, eruptive leather accord. Warm and invigorating simultaneously. From the alleys of the vibrant Palermo, between cardamom and coriander seed oil, on the flowery heights of Taormina, a violet-leaf accord, into the Valley of the Temples, the beautiful Sicilian soul unfolds. In its lands, in its mountains, a path of resins and woods winds its way. Cedar atlas oil, gaiac wood oil. For her, a perfume that is as telluric as it is aerial, which allows the encounter of water and fire, cedrat and leather.',

Vanilla accentuates the sensuality of the composition at the base, mingling with white musk, cashmeran, cedarwood and incense. With a vibrant radiance and a stirring floral composition, Delina is the perfect touch of modern femininity and sensorial delight capturing the beauty of its wearer. Presented in a powdery pink attire and composed around a harmony of Turkish rose that encapsulates sensuality, freshness and luxuriousness, the perfume takes aesthetes and connoisseurs through an overarching narrative of mystery and charm. Best time to wear: Spring and summer, during the day.',
